# MH-Python-Chat-Program
Group project for a networking class. Simple local chat server and client in Python.
I mainly worked on the encryption and message sending portion of this, but helped the group wherever I could.
RSA encryption keys are static as there would not be a safe way to transfer newly generated keys with this implementation.

Open both files in Pycharm or other IDE/compiler. Run the server file and enter a name, then run the client file and enter a name. They should be connected.
Messages can only be sent one after the other. Messages are printed in a static RSA key encryption and decrypted versions.
